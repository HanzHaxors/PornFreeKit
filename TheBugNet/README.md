# TheBugNet
TheBugNet works just like a bug net, it catch but it could also release. The point is, TheBugNet is NOT 100% effective and will ALWAYS improve as porn sites evolve too. TheBugNet works on client-side HTTP socket using basic proxy to modify the packet's content (mainly images) if the content detected as inappropriate content. The founder of this project is Hanz and he anonymize his real name so he can work without worries. Cheers!
